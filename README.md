# Blackjack
This is one of the first applications I ever made, so obviously it isn't the greatest ... I made this project in my first year of T163 Game Programming at George Brown College.

This game is just a typical Blackjack game made in Visual Studio 2012. It has a fake "login screen", a fake "purchase chips" screen and an options screen where you can change the background used and card images. Other than those features, there's the base game itself; bet chips, deal cards, normal blackjack interactions.
